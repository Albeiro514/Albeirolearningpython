    "<i>I am currently working as a manager in a e-learning software company. While doing my job last year, I came across the need for real data to make correct decisions, that's when I started learning data analysis. I took the data analyst specialization offered by IBM through Coursera, and that helped me a lot to communicate findings from my data to the stakeholders. Additionally, we are making important and strategic decisions based on that analysis. I don't have a college degree, and one of my challenges is to demonstrate that one can make data science without being a Ph.D. That's why this specialization was so engaging for me, I saw this same description on the course program page, and I got motivated and realized that it is possible. I consider that in technology you can learn almost everything by yourself. As you can probably read from my text, this industry causes a great passion in me because I think education is going to change, and degrees will be adjusted to include autonomous learners.</i>"
